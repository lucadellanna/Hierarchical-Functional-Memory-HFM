# Hierarchical Functional Memory (HFM)
A framework for an AI able to instinctively disambiguate contexts, built upon Numenta's Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) Framework.

This is an implementation of the whitepaper "Techniques for the Emergence of Meaning in Machine Learning" https://www.luca-dellanna.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Techniques-for-the-Emergence-of-Meaning-in-ML.pdf

(work in progress, I plan to finish the readme on the evening of the 27th of March, 2019)
